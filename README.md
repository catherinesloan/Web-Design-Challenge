### Background:
I have used data from a previous project, [Weather API](https://github.com/catherinesloan/python-api-challenge), to plot visualisations and their coreesponding explanations onto a website.

### Task:
To create a visualisation dashboard website with individual pages for each plot and a way to navigate between them. 

### Output: 

1. A landing page:
   - An explanation of the project
   - Links to each visualisations page
   - A sidebar containing preview images of each plot
   - Ability to click an image taking the user to that visualisation

2. Four visualisation pages, each with:
  - A descriptive title and heading tag
  - The plot itself for the selected comparison
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance

3. A comparisons page:
  - Contains all of the visualisations on the same page, allowing the user to easily visually compare them

4. A data page:
  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualisations, used Pandas 'to_html' function
 
5. Navigation menu:
  - 'Summary' on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page
  - Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualisation page
  - "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page
